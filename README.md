Credit Risk Assessment and Default Prediction
• Developed an XGBoost model for credit default prediction using the American Express Credit Default dataset, optimizing the strategy to achieve an 8.01% default rate while maximizing revenue.
•	Conducted data modeling, statistical analysis, hyperparameter tuning, and SHAP analysis to evaluate model performance, comparing
XGBoost, neural networks, and ensemble models. The XGBoost model outperformed neural networks by 11.6% in prediction accuracy
